## Project Description
Aim of the project is to get the training and test data sets from the experiment 
"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" combine, clean and then analyse them.

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphone
###Notes on the original (raw) data 
The files of intrest are
the actual observations recorded in  files as X_train and X_test.
The subjects on whom the observations were made are  present in the subject_test and subject_train files
The activity for whom the observations are recorded are present in y_test and y_train files
The decription of the activities are present in the activity_labels files


##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
1 Down load the files from the link provided(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2 Uncompress them and copy then above mentioned files to your working directory
3: Read the features representing out variables for the observations as a table,Transpose it such that the second row can be used to assign names to the observation table
4: Read the observations from the x_test in a table
5: Assign names from the step 3
6: Read y_test which is nothing but activity codes into a table
7: Read activities into the tables
8: Read the subject_test into a table.
9: Combined the tables in step5, 6 and 8 to get a complete test data set with activity labes and column names
10: Repeat the steps 4 thur 9 for Training dataset
11: Append the data in steps 10 and 11 to create a master data set of training and test observations combined
12: Next find the indices of the columns that contain the mean and std deviation
13: Use those indiced to retain the columns in the master data set of further intrest including the subject, activity code and activity labels
14: Use the subset in step 14 and group on subject, activity code, and calculate mean of every other column to create a final data set.
15: Join the activity codes to activity labeles to get meaning full names for the activities
16: Subset and reorder to keep necessary columns.

###Cleaning of the data
Please refer ReadMe on the repo describes the over all requirement for cleaning the data.
##Description of the variables in the tidy data file
Final gives us a mean for every subject every activity for every variable of intrest.
 It contains 40 rows with 82 columns
 Note the COLUMN NAMES HAVE NOT BEING CHANGED INTENTIONALLY FROM ORIGINAL as Average of a mean column or stad deviation column would not mean any thing.
