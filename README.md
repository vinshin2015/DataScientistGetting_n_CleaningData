This repository contains a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1:Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2:Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3:Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4:Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5:From the above data set it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
